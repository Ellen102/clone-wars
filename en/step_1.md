## Introduction:
In this project children will learn how to make a game, in which the player controls a spaceship that can fire lightning bolts at enemies.

## Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/46018140/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ CloneWars.sb2

## Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of previous programming skills learnt, and demonstrates how sprites can create clones of _other_ sprites, and how multiple clones can be used as projectiles.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ "Fixing the lightning" - using a `wait`{:class="blockcontrol"} block to reduce the frequency of the lightning;
+ "Lives and score" - creating `lives`{:class="blockdata"}, `score`{:class="blockdata"} and `highscore`{:class="blockdata"} variables;
+ "Improve your game" - adding extra enemies, health packs, etc.
