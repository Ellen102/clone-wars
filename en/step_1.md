## Introduction

In this project you'll learn how to create a game in which you have to save the Earth from space monsters.

### Instructions

Score as many points as you can by shooting flying space hippos. You'll lose a life if you get hit by a hippo or the oranges dropped by the fruit bats.

Click the green flag to start the game, and then use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship and the space key to shoot.
