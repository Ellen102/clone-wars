Let's make a spaceship that will defend the Earth!

+ Open a new empty Scratch project.

[[[generic-scratch-new-project]]]

+ Add the 'stars' backdrop and the 'Spaceship' sprite to your project.

+ Add code to move your spaceship to the left and right when the left arrow keys are pressed.

 	Test and save.

--- hint ---
When the __green flag is clicked__, your spaceship sprite should check __if__ the __left key is pressed__. If it is pressed, your spaceship should move to the left by changing it's __x position__. This check should be made __forever__ .

Your code should also check to see whether the __right key is pressed__, and move the spaceship if it is.
